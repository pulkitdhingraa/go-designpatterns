Design a Music Streaming App where users can create playlists and listen to songs.
Implement Iterator Pattern to allow users to browse through the playlist one song at a time, without exposing the internal structure of the playlist.

Requirements
Implement a Playlist class that contains a list of Song objects.

Create an Iterator that allows sequential traversal of songs.

Provide a PlaylistIterator that supports:

next(): Move to the next song.

prev(): Move to the previous song.

hasNext(): Check if more songs are available.

hasPrev(): Check if previous songs exist.

reset(): Restart from the first song.

Ensure that the Playlist does not expose its internal structure to the client.
